# Codeware-8-kyu-Is-it-even-
<br><br>
In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
<br>
Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
<br>
The function needs to return either a true or false.
<br>
Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
<br>
Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
